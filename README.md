## Getting Started
Install srteamlit ,sklearn,pandas,numpy packages and create a conda environment.

## Dataset
The "Face dataset" is a fictional dataset often used for educational purposes, data analysis practice, and machine learning tutorials. It simulates face data for an computer vission and includes various facial features that is unique to specific individual. Below is an overview of the typical features included in this dataset:

## Model Selection
Random Forest model is selected.
Reason:The freatures are non-linearly dependent with the target variable.

## Training Instructions
Save the images in respective male and female forlder for training
Run the train.py file
Trained model will be saved in save_models folder for inference

## Inferencing
Place a single iamge in the test_image_folder with name test.jpg
Run the main.py file
